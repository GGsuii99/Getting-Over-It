          <h2>game story</h2>
          <p>
            Hans Bohr, a 28-year old Danish carpenter. He moved to Belgium to
            work. he gets a job as a carpenter for an Carpentry Company. After
            working for there for 3 years, he decides to apply for the manager
            position after his manager was let go after having trouble with the
            law. His manager Louis Peeters, believed that Hans had somehow set
            him and derailed his entire career that he had worked so hard for.
            One fateful stormy night, Louis apprehends Hans on his walk home
            from work. Louis drives up to him at a dangerous speed, and drives
            over his foot. Hans falls over, holding his foot in pain. Louis gets
            out of the car, and opens his trunk. He pulls out a large, rusty
            Cauldron, and begins walking towards Hans. “Please.. no..” Louis
            picked up Hans and put him into the Cauldron, feet first.
          </p>
          <p>
            He drags it to the side of the nearby pier, and without a second
            thought, throws him into the sea. Louis laughed, and picked up Hans’
            hammer. He then threw the hammer at Hans as hard as he could. Hans,
            thinking quickly, flipped the Cauldron over and barely caught the
            hammer. The storm began to create towering waves with a mighty
            force. Hans and the Cauldron were lost at sea. For what seemed like
            years, Hans drifed in the open ocean. Eventually, he woke up after
            something hit his head. He looked up, to see that he had reached
            land. Desperate to find help, and to get out of the Cauldron, Hans
            used the only resources he had to make his way up the mountain that
            he hoped, on the other side, there would be civlization.

          <h2>gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            The controls are fairly easy to grasp. You do not need a keyboard.
            All you need to Get Over It is your mouse. Your goal is to reach the
            summit of this mountain, and the first obstacle you are faced with
            is a giant dead tree. A maneuver that you must know in order to have
            a chance at surviving this game is what I like to call the “Pogo
            Pounce.” Simply place the end of the hammer beneath you, and push
            off the ground. This should generate enough force to launch your
            self up decent heights. You need to know this for many of the
            obstacles.
