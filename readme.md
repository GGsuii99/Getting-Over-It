# Gameplay
The controls are fairly easy to grasp. You do not need a keyboard. All you need to Get Over It is your mouse. Your goal is to reach the summit of this mountain, and the first obstacle you are faced with is a giant dead tree. A maneuver that you must know in order to have a chance at surviving this game is what I like to call the “Pogo Pounce.” Simply place the end of the hammer beneath you, and push off the ground. This should generate enough force to launch your self up decent heights. You need to know this for many of the obstacles.
## Stage 1 Description
**Stage 1** Is the first stage the player encounters when starting the game. The player must first navigate over a small tree, after which they reach the mountain itself. This first stage is primarily vertical, with obstacles being only a short distance away from each other. The ending obstacle for the stage is known as the **Devil's Chimney**, a small tunnel with two lamps inside. The player must hook the lamps to propel themselves upward.
### Notable Parts
- The dead tree is the first obstacle in the game. The player uses the hammer to hook onto the tree, perhaps lowering themselves onto a branch, where they can pogo-jump upwards to the next branch.
- There is a small pile of rocks the player must get climb before reaching the mountain.
- There is a paddle that sticks out of the bottom part of the mountain the player can grab onto.
- There is a small hut towards the bottom of the mountain. The player should boost themselves upwards, hooking onto the other end of the roof (or gain enough momentum to do so otherwise).
- A barrel and a coffee cup sit on a rock that the player vertically climbs.
- At the end of the stage is the Devil's Chimney. It is a narrow, vertical tunnel with two lamps on either side and at different heights. Ideally, the player would grab onto or pull themselves onto the lamps.
## Stage 2 Description
**Stage 2** is the second stage in Getting Over It, which the player reaches if they successfully clear the Devil's Chimney. It introduces obstacles in which the player moves laterally for the first time. In the playground area, it is possible to fall back down to the starting area by falling past the Danger sign. The stage includes a large skip that the player can use to skip the playground area and cardboard boxes completely. If the player reaches the house section, they can hook the roof, position their hammer directly lined up with the satellite dish, position themselves to the side of the roof, and pull straight up. If the player is lined up correctly, this move will allow them to get high enough to grab onto the staircase, thereby skipping the majority of Stage 2. The ending obstacle is known as Orange Hell, and is possibly the most difficult obstacle in the game, due to the fact that it has very few hammer holds, and a fall will mean the player falls back to at least the playground section, but possibly the starting area. 
### Notable Parts
- The first obstacle of this area is what looks like a rusting metal fridge or storage unit. The player must fling themselves upward from here, hooking onto ledges of the building.
- The slide skip is a long metal beam in which the player must use the hammer to cling onto and skip across. The player can also rest atop it, if they somehow manage to get there.
- On top the house where the slide skip ends, the player can boost themselves upwards and if done correctly can skip a portion of the map.
- The player must jump between a grill and a sideways house, where they must hook onto an umbrella, rake, wheelbarrow, and play structure while climbing vertically.
    - If the player misses the jump between the grill and the house, they will land on a concrete wall below it, where they can climb back onto the house. If the player misses this wall or falls off of it, they will fall back to stage 1.
- At the top of the roof of the playing structure, the player must boost themselves right onto a pile of boxes, where they then must descend upon another row of boxes, and finally end up on a white staircase.
- A small chair sits on the staircase. The player should place themselves on top of it, boosting themselves upward and hooking onto the security camera or other small ledges.
- **Orange Hell.**
