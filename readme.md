# Gameplay
The controls are fairly easy to grasp. You do not need a keyboard. All you need to Get Over It is your mouse. Your goal is to reach the summit of this mountain, and the first obstacle you are faced with is a giant dead tree. A maneuver that you must know in order to have a chance at surviving this game is what I like to call the “Pogo Pounce.” Simply place the end of the hammer beneath you, and push off the ground. This should generate enough force to launch your self up decent heights. You need to know this for many of the obstacles.
