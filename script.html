          <h2>Stage 1 Description</h2>
          <p>
            Stage 1 Is the first stage the player encounters when starting the
            game. The player must first navigate over a small tree, after which
            they reach the mountain itself. This first stage is primarily
            vertical, with obstacles being only a short distance away from each
            other. The ending obstacle for the stage is known as the Devil's
            Chimney, a small tunnel with two lamps inside. The player must hook
            the lamps to propel themselves upward.
          </p>
          <h3>Notable Parts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The dead tree is the first obstacle in the game. The player uses
              the hammer to hook onto the tree, perhaps lowering themselves onto
              a branch, where they can pogo-jump upwards to the next branch.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a small pile of rocks the player must get climb before
              reaching the mountain.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a paddle that sticks out of the bottom part of the
              mountain the player can grab onto.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a small hut towards the bottom of the mountain. The
              player should boost themselves upwards, hooking onto the other end
              of the roof (or gain enough momentum to do so otherwise).
            </li>
            <li>
              A barrel and a coffee cup sit on a rock that the player vertically
              climbs.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the stage is the Devil's Chimney. It is a narrow,
              vertical tunnel with two lamps on either side and at different
              heights. Ideally, the player would grab onto or pull themselves
              onto the lamps.
            </li>
